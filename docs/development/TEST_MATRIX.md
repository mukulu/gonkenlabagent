# GonKenLab Agent Test Matrix

## 1. Test evidence rules

- `PASS` means the stated check passed in the recorded environment; it does not imply a higher test tier passed.
- `FAIL` means the test ran and an unmet requirement or unavailable prerequisite was observed.
- `BLOCKED` means required target conditions were unavailable.
- `NOT RUN` means the action was deliberately outside the milestone scope.
- Hardware results must record Pi model/RAM, OS image/version, kernel, architecture, Python, connected devices, power supply, cooling, commit, and test date.
- A later success does not erase earlier evidence; append a new result or explicitly supersede it.

## 2. Test tiers

| Tier | Name | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| T0 | Repository/static | syntax, formatting, config parse, inventory, Git integrity, secret/static scans |
| T1 | Host unit | deterministic tests with no live models, network, service, or hardware |
| T2 | Architecture install | dependency/install checks on target ARM64 OS or faithful clean image |
| T3 | Pi software | provisioned Pi without requiring external peripherals |
| T4 | Pi hardware | configured USB audio/GPIO/cooling and end-to-end physical behavior |
| T5 | Boot/recovery | reboot, service order, crash restart, hotplug, late network, upgrade, uninstall |
| T6 | Failure injection/security | interrupted steps, corrupted artifacts, low disk, permission failures, adversarial commands/privacy |

## 4. Required future suites

The master blueprint must allocate stable IDs and concrete procedures for at least:

### Installation

- pristine supported Raspberry Pi OS Lite image;
- supported Python version matrix;
- non-root sudo user and explicit-root invocation;
- missing sudo, no network, DNS failure, clock skew, proxy, low disk, low memory;
- second/third identical invocation;
- interruption during APT, pip, Ollama install, model pull, Whisper clone/build/model download, Piper download;
- corrupted/zero-byte/wrong-checksum artifacts;
- existing dirty/untracked checkout and unexpected origin;
- upgrade from the inspected baseline and rollback.

### Runtime and service

- enable/start/stop/restart/status and clean journal output;
- boot with Ollama ready, delayed, failed, and missing model;
- boot with audio present, absent, late, renamed, duplicated, or disconnected mid-use;
- signal handling during idle, recording, inference, and speech;
- crash-loop prevention/watchdog behavior;
- correct service user/groups/filesystem permissions;
- no requirement for interactive autologin.

### Models and configuration

- installer/runtime/doctor/service/test model agreement;
- exact tag/digest presence and real inference;
- model pull recovery and insufficient-space handling;
- explicit endpoint consistency;
- environment/config precedence and invalid-value rejection;
- reasonable context/RAM/thermal limits for Pi 5 4GB.

### Audio and interaction

- microphone/speaker selection with multiple devices;
- supported sample rates and resampling quality;
- silence/no-speech/long-speech/noise behavior;
- TTS artifact cleanup;
- feedback-loop prevention;
- custom Gonken wake-word true/false-positive tests across speakers and noise;
- physical/manual recovery path;
- recording indicator consistency.

### Privacy, tools, and grounding

- no outbound request in offline mode;
- no raw-audio persistence by default;
- no transcript in telemetry-only mode;
- allow-listed read-only tools;
- shutdown/reboot exact phrase + confirmation + cancel/timeout;
- prompt/tool injection cannot execute arbitrary commands;
- retrieval hit@k, provenance coverage, unsupported-answer behavior;
- logs/support bundles redact secrets and sensitive content.

## 5. Latest test summary

- **T0:** 9 PASS, 4 FAIL findings.
- **T1:** no real unit suite exists yet.
- **T2:** one limited dependency probe FAIL/risk; full target install NOT RUN.
